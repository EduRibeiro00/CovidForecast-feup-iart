* Developed a full game with menu, difficulty selection, visual interface, etc. Allows Human v Human, Human vs Computer and Computer vs Computer, on 5x5, 7x7 and 11x11 boards;
* Developed various levels of AI using the Minimax algorithm and implemented optimizations like Alpha-Beta pruning;
* Languages/technologies used: **Python.**

**Grade**: 19.5 / 20

**Project 2: Covid Forecast Tool**

* Extracted Covid-19 data from a Kaggle dataset that contained the confirmed, death, and recovered cases for each day and for each country/region; developed and trained several regression models with the goal of successfully predicting Covid-19 cases and deaths;
* Used data visualization Python libraries to create graphs in order to better understand data patterns;
* Utilized the following models and methods: Neural Networks, Stochastic Gradient Descent, Support Vector Machines, K-Nearest Neighbours and Random Forest.
* Languages/technologies used: **Python, Jupyter Notebook, SKLearn, Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.**
* Kaggle dataset used: https://www.kaggle.com/imdevskp/corona-virus-report?select=covid_19_clean_complete.csv
